# Antares Modeler Presentation

**Antares Simulator** is an open-source power system simulator designed to quantify the adequacy and economic performance of interconnected energy systems in the long term. It is used by transmission system operators for probabilistic simulations of energy consumption, generation, and transportation.

The **Antares Modeler** is the core interface of the Antares Simulator, offering advanced features for building, configuring, and running simulations. It is designed for flexibility, allowing users to adapt models to their specific study needs, including integration with tools like GEMS.
