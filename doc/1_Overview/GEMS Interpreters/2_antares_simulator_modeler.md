# Antares Modeler Presentation

The **Antares** Modeler is a graph-based optimization problem builder that provides a comprehensive environment for constructing, configuring, and solving LP, MIP, and MILP problems. Its design emphasizes flexibility, enabling users to tailor mathematical formulations, data structures, and model components to suit the specific requirements of their studies.

Integrated alongside the **Antares Simulator [^1]**, the Modeler introduces new possibilities for extending legacy optimization structures directly within Antares studies. This integration enables users to broaden the standard simulation framework by creating new models and exploring enhanced problem formulations, all while remaining fully compatible with the Antares Simulator ecosystem.

For detailed Modeler usage and examples, see:

- [Installation Guide](../../2_Getting%20Started/1_installation.md)
- [Examples section](../../5_Examples/)
- [The official Antares Simulator Documentation - Modeler section](https://antares-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/modeler/01-overview-modeler/)



[^1]: **Antares Simulator** is an open-source power system simulator designed to quantify the adequacy and economic performance of interconnected energy systems in the long term. It is used by transmission system operators for probabilistic simulations of energy consumption, generation, and transportation.
