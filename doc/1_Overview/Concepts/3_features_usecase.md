# GEMS Features

## Main Mathematical Programming Features

- **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP):** GEMS is designed to handle mathematical problems requiring Mixed Integer Linear Programming.
- **Time × Scenario Optimization:** Problems over a time × scenario grid can be solved.
- **2-Stage Stochastic Linear Programming:** GEMS can support optimization problems that can be two-stage stochastic.

## Use Cases

GEMS was primarily designed for the following purposes:

- **Adequacy Assessment:** GEMS is designed to measure the ability of an energy system to supply the load through time and scenario.
- **Economic Dispatch:** It also optimizes the dispatch levels of electricity generators to minimize the overall cost of electricity generation while meeting demand and operational constraints.
- **Energy System Planning:** Simulations help strategic development and coordination of electricity infrastructure to ensure a reliable and cost-effective energy supply in the long term.

## Energy System modelling

- **Multi-Energy modelling:** Multi-energy systems can be modeled by GEMS. While ANTARES mainly focuses on the electric grid, GEMS can handle multi-energy systems.
- **Antares Legacy Integration (Hybrid Mode):** A study can be composed of a "hybrid" simulation made of two simulation parts, one from Legacy and the other from GEMS.
- **Model Taxonomy:** In the GEMS framework, taxonomy enforces consistency across models by aligning their categorization, expected outputs, and UI representation, enabling reliable and coherent model interactions.
